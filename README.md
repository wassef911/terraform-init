## terraform demo:

You should have file ./envs_config.tfvars

```tfvars

environments = [
  {
    aws_region       = "us-east-1"
    instance_type        = "t2.micro"
    key_name         = "nope"
    env_short          = "prod"
  },
  {

    instance_type        = "t2.micro"

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
